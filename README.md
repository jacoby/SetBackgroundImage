# SetBackgroundImage
  
  C# Command tool to turn a JPG into a Background Image

# Details

This is the fourth C# program I wrote, after HelloWorld, Iterative Fibonacci and Recursive Fibonacci. 
I found details on MSDN (https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/CSSetDesktopWallpaper-2107409c) and worked from there.
